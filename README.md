# Iterm
 An ios terminal emulator with procursus suite


# What is Iterm?
Iterm is a jailed terminal emulator with the procursus suite, this can lead to jailed jailbreak development. As for why it can be used when jailbroken, it can be used as a fully fuctioning emulator and a root terminal (broken right now)
